        <h1>Client Website</h1>
        <p>I successfully delivered my first client project using React, creating a fully functional website with responsive design for various screens.</p>
        <p>The website is designed for a Construction Company, based in Johannesburg and includes features such as navigating through different pages of
           the website.</p>
           <p>As the sole front-end developer, I implemented navigation through different pages using REACT Router library and ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
            I also made sure that there is consistency with the colors of the website.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> React and CSS for styling.</p>
         <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The challenge That I faced during the project, was working with images on the cards, The size of the images kept on changing
           across the cards. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>TimeLine:</strong>It took me 2 weeks to complete the project.</p>
