        <h1>Job Listing with Filtering</h1>
        <p>I created a Job Listing application with filtering. I used Json to store and retrieve the data. You can be able 
           to search for a job using the search bar, and you can also clear the filter as well.
        </p>
        <p>This application is one of the FrontEnd Mentor challenges that I came across, the challenge is on intermediate level. My primary focus was to 
           practice my FrontEnd skills.</p>
         <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> React and CSS for styling.</p>
         <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The challenge That I faced during the project, was making sure that the content is 
            properly aligned and adjusting the width and height of the elments. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>TimeLine:</strong>It took me 2 weeks to complete the project.</p>
